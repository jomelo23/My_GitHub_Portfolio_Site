    I am a graduate of the <em>Universities of Sheffield and Waterloo</em>. Currently working as a Line Operations Manager at Procter and Gamble.

    <br />
    <p>In my daily role, I work with my team, including over 5 direct reports, on process optimization to manage the business measured in our key KPI, including process reliability, material utilization and case fill rate</p>

		<h3>Current Project</h3> <!-- Insert link here -->
		<p> My current project. As a minority aspiring to a field in which there are not many people of my colour, I have had the chance to interview some of the greatest minds for #BlacksinData. It is series discussing how to break into the field of Data Science for everyone, but curated for minorities of colour.</p>
